> Additional information or tag line

A brief description of your project, what it is used for.

Example:

This repository is a simple template useful as a reference or for initializing new git repositories.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

###Example:

Follow the official Github documentation for creating a new repository using this template.
https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template

## Developing

### Built With
List main libraries, frameworks used including versions (React, Angular etc...)

### Prerequisites
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.

### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

Include some commands

```shell
commands here
```

###Example: 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/entisys360/git-template.git
cd git-template
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

###Example: 

Checks out a local copy of this repository.

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing
give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Versioning

We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [link to tags on this repository](/tags).


## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
```

## Style guide

Link to style guide.
Explain your code style and show how to check it.

## Api Reference

If the api is external, link to api documentation. If not describe your api including authentication methods as well as explaining all the endpoints with their required parameters.


## Resources

Explaining what resources are required to use this code (operating system, database, web server, docker image, etc. Specify versions.) 
Where possible provide links to sources..
