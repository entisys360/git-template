> Additional information or tag line

A brief description of your project, and what it is used for.


## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to validate or use the contents of this repository.


### Built With
List main libraries, frameworks used including versions (React, Angular etc...)

### Prerequisites
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies 
or any other tools. include download links.

### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

Include some commands

```shell
commands here
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing

Give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.


## Versioning

Versioning should be decided on a case-by-case basis for each project. 
Versioning details should be clearly documented here and enforced by 
precommit-hooks where possible.


## Configuration

Here you should document any additional configuration required by the user 
of this code. Include per-platform instructions or links where appropriate.


## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
```

## Style guide

Link to main style guide.
Explain any code style changes specific to this repository and show how to validate.


## Quick command reference / API reference

Any information that you want to be quickly retrievable. A great place for 
examples or common commands.

If there is an api that is external, link to api documentation. If the repo
contains an api include authentication methods as well as explaining all the 
endpoints with their required parameters.
